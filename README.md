# Face Censor Tool

## Overview
This Python tool allows users to automatically detect and blur faces or other regions in photos and videos. The idea for this tool was inspired by the project [Blurry Faces](https://github.com/asmaamirkhan/BlurryFaces), and we've created a slightly custom manipulated version for specific use cases.

## Credits
This tool is based on the original [Blurry Faces](https://github.com/asmaamirkhan/BlurryFaces) GitHub repository by [Asmaa Mirkhan](https://github.com/asmaamirkhan). We acknowledge the work done in the original repository, and our tool is a derivative with some custom modifications.
