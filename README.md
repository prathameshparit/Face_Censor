# Face Censor Tool

## Overview
This Python tool allows users to automatically detect and blur faces or other regions in photos and videos. The idea for this tool was inspired by the project [Blurry Faces](https://github.com/asmaamirkhan/BlurryFaces), and we've created a slightly custom manipulated version for specific use cases.
